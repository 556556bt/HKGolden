# What is HKGolden
The HKGolden repository includes two projects: HKGolden & HKGoldenAPI. This repository aims to build a universal Windows app for Windows 10 that is free to all Windows 10 users. The app will work on any device, including both dektops and mobile phones, that runs Windows 10.

#Why HKGolden
HKGolden is one of the most visited websites in Hong Kong. However, there is neither an official Windows Phone app or a good-enough 3rd-party app for it. The app gap is one of the biggest deal breakers for people who want to give Windows Phone a try. Does being a Windows fan mean using inferior apps? The answer is absolutely NO. As an app developer, I am trying to end this, and this app is just my very first step. The HKGolden app will be completely free of charge, with the best features to offer among all platforms.

#But How?
HKGolden does not provide API access to developers, and that's why I will make my own API. To have an app working, the API must be finished first. It takes time, but it's worth the wait.

#Great! How can I help?
If you don't know anything about programming, it's fine. You can buy me (or maybe my team in the future) a cup of coffee since I won't earn a single penny from this app.
If you are a developer, I am glad you are here. You can clone the repo and look at the code. This app is still at its very early stage, and I'm sure you can help a lot. Please contact me so that I don't have to fight alone. Thanks.

#About Me
No I am not a software engineer. No I don't study computer science. I study Accounting and Finance at the university. But yes, I like the simplicity of Windows Phone. I don't want it to die. I am here to help save it. Have faith, and wait.
